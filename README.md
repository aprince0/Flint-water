# Flint-water

We consider the problem of estimating the risk of lead contamination in home drinking water. This work relies on a large collection of water samples taken by residents and
government offcials throughout the crisis. Beginning in late 2015, the State of Michigan initiated program allowing any resident to submit a tap water sample for testing. This dataset is a publicly
available collection of over 25,000 tests, and it provides a glimpse into the causes and extent of water lead contamination in Flint; it is indeed the largest dataset collected on lead in a municipal water
system. We combine these measurements with several other data sources, including census data, property attributes, geographical information, and infrastructure records, and we use the combined
data to answer several statistical and analytical questions. Among these are:

• To what extent can we predict elevated lead in a home’s
drinking water?
• What attributes of a home are associated with lead contamination?
• How can we address the sampling bias of volunteer residential
testing?
We present a number of additional results, and we conjecture that
many of these observations will generalize beyond Flint.
